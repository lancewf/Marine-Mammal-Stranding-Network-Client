Lance volunteers weekly at the library and rides his bike there. We have rescued a few seal pups; Lance got to take a boat ride around the islands to place a seal nearby a rookery that it may have come from. I will hopefully become the volunteer coordinator at the Animal Shelter at the end of the month, and will begin at the wildlife rescue this week. At the beginning of the week I became the Assistant Stage Manager and Assistant Director for a pay in the community theater. It is a volunteer position that is about 7 hours a week and will become about 20+ hours when the play opens in August and September. As a thank you for helping, the director of the play is helping teach me acting and auditioning skills so I can audition for a play that opens in October.","dayofmonth":11,"month":8,"year":2010},{"id":2,"title":"The one with the Series of Unfortunate Events","message":"So, things have really been moving along here on the island.
